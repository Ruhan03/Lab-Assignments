As Allied forces closed in on Berlin in April 1945, 
Hitler married his long-time partner, Eva Braun, in
his underground bunker. On April 30, 1945, less than
two days later, they both committed suicide to avoid
capture by the Soviet Red Army. Their bodies were cr-
emated according to his orders.
Hitler's actions resulted in the deadliest conflict 
in history, with an estimated 70 to 85 million deaths
worldwide, and he is widely regarded as an embodiment
of modern political evil.
